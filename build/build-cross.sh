# GoLang cross-compile snippet for Go 1.6+ based loosely on Dave Chaney's cross-compile script:
# http://dave.cheney.net/2012/09/08/an-introduction-to-cross-compilation-with-go
#
# To use:
#
#   $ cd ~/path-to/my-awesome-project
#   $ go-build-all
#
# Features:
#
#   * Cross-compiles to multiple machine types and architectures.
#   * Uses the current directory name as the output name...
#     * ...unless you supply an source file: $ go-build-all main.go
#   * Windows binaries are named .exe.
#   * ARM v5, v6, v7 and v8 (arm64) support
#
# ARM Support:
#
# You must read https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoArm for the specifics of running
# Linux/BSD-style kernels and what kernel modules are needed for the target platform.
# While not needed for cross-compilation of this script, you're users will need to ensure
# the correct modules are included.
#
# Requirements:
#
#   * GoLang 1.6+ (for mips and ppc), 1.5 for non-mips/ppc.
#   * CD to directory of the binary you are compiling. $PWD is used here.
#
# For 1.4 and earlier, see http://dave.cheney.net/2012/09/08/an-introduction-to-cross-compilation-with-go
#

# This PLATFORMS list is refreshed after every major Go release.
# Though more platforms may be supported (freebsd/386), they have been removed
# from the standard ports/downloads and therefore removed from this list.
#
PLATFORMS="darwin/amd64 darwin/arm64"
PLATFORMS="$PLATFORMS windows/amd64 windows/386" # arm compilation not available for Windows
PLATFORMS="$PLATFORMS linux/amd64 linux/386"
PLATFORMS="$PLATFORMS linux/ppc64 linux/ppc64le"
PLATFORMS="$PLATFORMS linux/arm linux/arm64"

# ARMBUILDS lists the platforms that are currently supported.  From this list
# we generate the following architectures:
#
#   ARM64 (aka ARMv8) <- only supported on linux and darwin builds (go1.6)
#   ARMv7
#   ARMv6
#   ARMv5
#
# Some words of caution from the master:
#
#   @dfc: you'll have to use gomobile to build for darwin/arm64 [and others]
#   @dfc: that target expects that you're bulding for a mobile phone
#   @dfc: iphone 5 and below, ARMv7, iphone 3 and below ARMv6, iphone 5s and above arm64
#
